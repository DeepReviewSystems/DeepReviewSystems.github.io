            <h2>Our Process</h2>
            <p>At DeepReview Systems LLC, we follow a structured, transparent process to ensure quality, efficiency, and client satisfaction at every stage of your systematic review project. Here’s what you can expect:</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>1. Initial Contact and Project Review</h3>
            <p>In the initial phase, we connect with the client to discuss their project requirements. We will review:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>PICO Research Question:</strong> The specific research question, ideally in PICO format.</li>
                <li><strong>Screening Criteria:</strong> Inclusion and exclusion criteria that will guide the relevance assessment of abstracts.</li>
                <li><strong>Search Strategy:</strong> The specific search terms (and associated databases) used in your systematic review.</li>
                <li><strong>Dataset Overview:</strong> Metadata on the dataset, such as the estimated number of abstracts to be screened.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This information helps us understand the project scope and prepare an initial assessment.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>2. Initial Estimate of Time and Cost</h3>
            <p>Based on our initial review, we will provide an estimate of the time and cost required to complete the project. If the project falls outside our area of expertise, we will let you know at this stage. While each project is unique, typical guidelines include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cost Estimate:</strong> Pricing follows a staged model, where average (per abstract) cost decreases with higher volumes. Projects with 10,000 to 30,000 abstracts may cost approximately USD$ 0.3-0.5 per abstract, subject to adjustments for complexity and volume. </li>
                <li><strong>Time Estimate:</strong> Projects of this size (10,000 to 30,000 abstracts) generally take 2 to 4 weeks to complete, depending on specifics.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These are preliminary figures; a more precise estimate will follow in the formal contract.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>3. Project Setup Fee and Contract Preparation</h3>
            <p>If the client agrees with the initial quote, we may proceed with a non-refundable project setup fee of up to USD $50, depending on the project's scope and requirements. This fee covers administrative tasks, client consultations, and project customization.</p>
            <p>Once the client has paid the setup fee (if applicable) and submitted the required dataset of abstracts, we will prepare a customized contract that details the specific project milestones, quality control measures, and payment terms. Each contract is uniquely tailored to the project requirements, ensuring clarity and alignment from the start.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>4. Project Execution and Milestone Payments</h3>
            <p>Once the contract is signed, the project begins. Work is divided into stages, with key milestones identified. The client makes payments in installments according to these milestones, as outlined in the contract.</p>
            <p>Throughout the project, we provide progress updates, allowing the client to stay informed at each stage. Quality control measures are integrated at each milestone to ensure accuracy and reliability.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Quality Control and Inspection</h3>
            <p>We follow rigorous quality control processes at each stage of the project. Detailed criteria for inspecting the accuracy of abstract screening results are described in the contract to ensure an objective review for both sides.</p>
            <p>This inspection protocol ensures transparency, reliability, and satisfaction, helping us deliver results that meet the highest standards.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Final Deliverables</h3>
            <p>Upon completion of the final milestone and all quality checks, we provide the screened abstracts categorized according to your criteria. This final deliverable is designed for easy integration into your systematic review process, enabling you to move forward confidently with high-quality data.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Additional Notes</h3>
            <p>Our process is designed to be flexible and client-centered. We work closely with you throughout the project, ensuring that each step aligns with your needs and expectations. For any questions or custom requests, please don’t hesitate to reach out at info@deep-review-systems.com.</p>
