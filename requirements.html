            <h2>Client Requirements</h2>
            <p>To ensure a smooth, efficient, and accurate abstract screening process, we ask our clients to provide the following information at certain steps. Clear and complete information helps us deliver the best possible results tailored to your project’s needs.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>1. Project Objective and Screening Criteria</h3>
            <p>To accurately identify relevant studies, we need a well-defined project objective, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Research Question:</strong> Specify the question guiding your review, ideally in PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome) format or any format relevant to your field.</li>
                <li><strong>Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria:</strong> Provide detailed criteria for determining relevance, specifying what characteristics make a study relevant or irrelevant for your systematic review.</li>
                <li><strong>Search Strategy:</strong> To help us tailor the screening process to your needs, please provide the specific search terms (and associated databases) used in your systematic review. </li>
                    <!-- This information will allow us to optimise the algorithms based on your unique research context.</li> -->
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>2. Dataset for Screening</h3>
            <p>After the initial set-up and agreement to proceed, we will ask you to submit the dataset of studies to be screened in a standardized format. This ensures compatibility with our screening tools and facilitates an accurate and efficient process.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>File Format:</strong> The dataset should be provided in a compatible format, such as <code>.ris</code> (Research Information Systems format). Please reach out if you have other formats, as we may be able to convert them.</li>
                <li><strong>For Updated Systematic Reviews:</strong> If your project is an update of a previous systematic review, please include the labels (e.g., “relevant” or “irrelevant”) from the previous review. This helps us refine the screening for new studies, speeding up the update process.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>3. Timeline</h3>
            <p>To ensure timely delivery, please provide your estimated timeline and any specific deadlines. Understanding your schedule allows us to plan our workflow and prioritize tasks to meet your project needs effectively. Our abstract screening process combines human curation with AI and machine learning inputs to maintain high quality. As a result, a typical abstract screening project requires a minimum of two weeks to complete. </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Additional Notes</h3>
            <p>If you have any special requirements or additional details that might impact the screening process, please inform us at the start. We’re committed to customizing our approach to fit your unique project goals and constraints.</p>
